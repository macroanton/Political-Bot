D. On top of the points for the required tasks, I also: 
1. Made My 'Bottle__' account post submissions into BotTown's 0-2 subreddits using headlines.py
2. Had five bots total including ('BurberryBot','Lil-BabyBot','BackBot','Baloon-hOT') which had over 500 comments each
3. Had a total 1000 valid comments for 'Bottle__' which can be checked, along with the other bots, using bot_counter.py with the code 
```
python3 bot_counter.py --username Bottle__
```
